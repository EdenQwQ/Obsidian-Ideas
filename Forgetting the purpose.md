Sometimes I would be do something on a purpose. However, if that thing takes much time, I would forget the original purpose of doing so.

For example, today I want to eat watermelon but my spoon is unwashed, so I went to do the dishes instead. But when I finish doing the dishes, I went straight to the bathroom and cleaned myself, totally forgetting that I wanted to eat watermelon.
