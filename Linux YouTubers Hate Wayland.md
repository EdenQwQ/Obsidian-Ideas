Many liunx youtubers hate wayland! [[Feelings on Linux YouTubers]]

For example thelinuxcast is often against wayland and arguing that wayland is totally not ready for daily use.

I can only partly agree about their arguments.

Wayland is surely not so prepared to be a default for the most, but this process won't be pushed if no one uses it!
