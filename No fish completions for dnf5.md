The fish development member decided to leave this problem until most of people start using dnf5 and completely migrate from dnf to dnf5. https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9862

Why wouldn't them provide a dnf5.fish file first and allow users to do other stuff?

Anyways I've decided to live without fish completions for a while and use dnf search instead.
